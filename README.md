Features
=================

Eventcentric is a demo app using the Groupcentric SDK.

This app lists Eventbrite events around you and allows you to privately share and discuss them with friends.

This demonstrates sharing an app's rich content (an Eventbrite event) into a private group, as well as how important it is that people in that private group can view and chat about it right within the app.

Push Notifications are not live in this app. 

Don't forget to download the Groupcentric SDK first. The Eventcentric project references it under Properties > Android > Library. If you don't see it under Library then you must add it.
